## Advanced Parking Sensor Suitable for Hearing Impaired Use

This is a parking sensor that detects the obstacle in front of or behind the car with an ultrasonic sensor and transmits the distance data as a flashing light and as an informative display for hearing impaired drivers.

I tested this version with a car (Ford Focus Station Wagon 2018) in various weather conditions and on various road types and did not encounter any errors.

As this is a prototype, the ultrasonic sensor has to be manually attached to the front or rear of the vehicle.

In the next version, I intend to build a wireless connection between the ultrasonic sensor and the microprocessor.
